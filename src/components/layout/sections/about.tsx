            <p>In 2015 I entered the world of IT through a technical computer course at a Federal Institute in my city, and in 2021 I got my first opportunity in the work market - I'm still moving forward.</p>
            <p>My main focus these days is to learn as much as possible from colleagues at my current job.</p>
            <p>When I'm not programming I'm usually with my girlfriend, playing volleyball, running and at least one weekend a month I try to visit my family in my hometown.</p>
